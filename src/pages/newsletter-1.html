			<p>One of the top imperatives on everyone’s minds these days is personal well-being. The watchwords during the pandemic have been “stay at home” and “stay healthy”—which has led us to discover myriad ways of staying sane while in confinement.</p>

			<p>Artists and performers have been responding ebulliently to this challenge in diverse ways: inviting viewers into virtual studio visits, creating virtual concerts, hosting virtual dance parties. One of the most engaging of these performers is Hong Kong actor/singer/dancer Kathy Mak, who often uses humour and song to help audiences cope with feelings of helplessness. In a recent effort to warm the heart and lift the spirit, Mak offered a rendition of the 1990s pop hit “Torn,” by Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia, on YouTube.</p>

			<p>With a cabaret-type performance recorded on her cell phone, Mak has so far racked up over 500,000 views and sparked a minor sensation in Hong Kong, a city worn down by numbing headlines and daily safety concerns.</p>

			<h1>Art Is Still Here</h1>
			<p class="lead">A Hypothetical Show for a Closed Museum</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/1/640-3.jpg">
			<p class="caption">Lu Yang, Biological Strikeback!!!, 2010</p>

			<p>Visiting shows virtually and encountering art in this new way has been particularly rewarding the past few weeks. In many of these shows, themes of health, endurance, and survival through difficult times have emerged, as they resonate with the thoughts and feelings of so many artists showing in galleries and museums throughout the world. One such artist is Lu Yang (whose studio we visit next week...), who is currently included in a pioneering offering entitled Art Is Still Here: A Hypothetical Show for a Closed Museum from M WOODS curated by our Artistic Director and Chief Curator Victor Wang.</p>

			<p>Says the curator, “The show was conceived as a long-term visual project that will virtually occupy both M WOODS museum locations, 798 and Hutong… [including] artists and thinkers around the theme of ecology, nature, extinction, isolation and kinship….Through this activity we hope to continue our mission of working with artists to provide art for the public, making it accessible at all times and in all circumstances.”</p>

			<h1>Future Relics</h1>
			<p class="lead">Daniel Arsham’s Perpetual Present</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/1/daniel-arsham.png">

			<p>New York-based art star Daniel Arsham brought his fictional archaeology to China for the first time last year, with the vibrant opening in Shanghai's HOW Art Museum of Perpetual Present, an exhibition of what has been described as “objects imagined as archaeological artifacts set in an ambiguously distant future.”</p>

			<p>Mr Simon admires Arsham's works in sculpture and other media because of the haunting way he imagines his future relics. A visionary artist whose insights are both playful and powerful, Arsham turns objects from the late-20th century’s age of technological obsolescence, such as basketballs and shoes, into artifacts with the ghostly spirit of excavated stone. His work surges with Pop Art romanticism at its best, in which concepts of the present, the future, and the past poetically collide.</p>

			<p>And just last week, Arsham launched a new project, exclusively for China: Eroded Pikachu sculptures, available at the Archive Editions platform of limited art editions.</p>

			<h1>Jin Shan in <em>The Allure of Matter</em></h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/1/Jin-Shan_studio-visit.jpg">

			<p>Jin Shan is a Shanghai-based sculptor who makes works that suggest ghostly human bodies, twisted in time and deformed by computer and imagination. His work is a highlight in the insightful exhibition entitled The Allure of Matter, which was on view in Chicago at the Smart Museum and Wrightwood 659, and scheduled to tour further, when institutions were forced to close their doors for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The show, which includes twenty-one Chinese artists and originated at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, showcases artworks that combine traditional textures like silk with more contemporary, industrial materials, to offer commentary on China and the world.</p>

			<p>Mr Simon was in Los Angeles for the opening of the show at LACMA, where we had the pleasure of interviewing Jin Shan. The youngest Chinese artist in the exhibition, he is at the forefront of a generation of emerging Chinese artists and has risen to prominence as a playful cultural voice who prods us to think about who we are, where we came from and where we’re going. Utilizing varied materials, Jin Shan employs humor and satire to reflect the experiences of young people grappling with significant societal shifts.</p>

			<p>In walking through the halls of the exhibition with Mr Simon, LACMA’s director Michael Govan was effusive about Jin Shan’s work. Said Govan, “It’s essential to an understanding of the vision that a new generation of Chinese artists are bringing to the global stage.” Though the Smart Museum’s doors are temporarily closed, works from this powerful show can viewed online.</p>

			<h1>Zhang Enli’s Makeshift Studio</h1>
			<p class="lead">Curated by Venus Lau for K11</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/1/IMG_2565.jpg" alt="">

			<p>At this time last year, Mr Simon walked eagerly through Shanghai’s K11 art mall, located near Huaihai Park in the former Luwan District. What a remarkable art and shopping experience it is to meander through K11, which genially demands open eyes and full attention! Time spent at this visionary shopping mall is a brilliant way to support art and the museum space tucked inside.</p>

			<p>And it was a wonderful surprise at K11 to come across an immersive, studio-like exhibition by Shanghai-based master artist Zhang Enli, which was designed to suggest that the artist had just moments ago walked out of his studio and left us to focus on the poetic aspects of his daily life. For his latest series of paintings, such as those seen here and last season at Hauser & Wirth in New York, the artist has turned for inspiration to the environment of Shanghai, the city in which has lived since 1989. Designed a bit like a funhouse maze, the exhibition was sunny, sensual, playful, and performative—in short, a delight!</p>

			<h1>What We’re Listening to Right Now: “Sonic&nbsp;Cure”</h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/1/Ryuichi-Sakamoto_Improvisation-for-Sonic-Cure.01.png">

			<p>A UCCA-Beijing concert in February, 2020 featured multimedia artist Feng Mengbo, Pang Kuan (lead singer of New Pants, one of China’s most popular bands), and Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, whose performance featured a cymbal inscribed with the characters “Made in Wuhan” (appearing in the video below at 10:15). UCCA is the most important contemporary art museum in China. This concert was live-streamed to 100,000 viewers and has subsequently been watched by millions.</p>

			<spacer size="20"></spacer>

			<p>Says UCCC Director Philip Tinari: “Evolving out of a planned live concert series for the exhibition Voluntary Garden—UCCA’s last exhibition to open before the outbreak—this event was hosted on video platform Kuaisou with the support of Shanghai Tang…. As we wait to see what kind of changed world will emerge, we reaffirm, through our daily work, our belief in the unique and fundamental power of art to inspire reflection, enable dialogue, and envision solidarity.”</p>
