			<p>Due to the present crisis, the worlds of art, fashion, music, and design are rapidly developing their offerings on digital platforms. Overnight, the cues for some of our most engaged sensory and intellectual experiences have switched from the real world to the virtual. In this switch, our eyes claim primacy. We have become a population of housebound voyeurs. </p>

			<p>At times disturbed and maddened to be slowing down and/or physically confined, we have also undeniably now have more time for observation and reflection. Maybe we can't attend shows and concerts physically, but we can make the temporal and spatial jump to platforms that now offer a more massive array of fresh content and experience than ever before. Expanding rapidly right now are media pathways to new ideas, offering opportunities to discover the world as it evolves day by day, appealing to our enduring habits of seeking, questing, looking…</p>

			<h1>Cao Fei: “New capacities for alienation and love…”</h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/2/433C4006-B384-4AC3-933B-1ED101EB4B44.jpeg">

			<p class="caption">Cao Fei, <em>Nova</em>, 2019, video, color, sound, 109 minutes.</p>

			<p>Cao Fei is one of the most influential Chinese multimedia artists on the scene today. The 42-year old Guangzhou-born, Beijing-based artist has devoted herself to addressing what a recent Artforum interview called “social upheavals and breakneck urbanization through virtual, augmented, and mixed realities that chart new capacities for alienation and love.” Her recent solo exhibition at the London’s Serpentine Galleries, Blueprints, was forced to close in the wake of the global pandemic, but when speaking about the show Cao Fei said that “now is the new time for the human to discover the universal again. If you’re talking about a dead planet, I think maybe it’s a signal for people to think about what we are doing.”</p>

			<p>While Serpentine Galleries Artistic Director Hans Ulrich Obrist and Associate Curator Joseph Constable acknowledged the present challenging circumstances, they also saw Cao Fei's exhibition closure as a possible starting point. An online exhibition of moving-image works by East Asian artists, entitled Out Of Blueprints, was launched on April 2 by Serpentine Galleries in collaboration with K11 Art Foundation, on the NOWNESS video platform</p>

			<h1>Art Basel and BMW Journey winner Lu Yang</h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/2/3.Lu-Yang_Societe_ABHK19.png">

			<p>Rising star from Art Basel Hong Kong 2019, Lu Yang makes vibrant digital installations that conjure a dazzling digital arcade of Manga dream girls in existential crisis against blazing, iridescent, electric rainbow walls. In Lu Yang’s recent Art Basel Hong Kong presentation, hosted by Société Berlin, Mr Simon was transfixed by her fantasyland of freestanding vertical monitors in which radiant anime fetish figures were expressing and mutating themselves as genderless personifications of Buddhist teachings. The artist’s aesthetic system is a metaphor of the fragility of human beings.</p>

			<p>It was also Mr Simon’s pleasure to visit the studio of the Shanghai-based Lu Yang (see next article), where we learned that she is drawing the art world’s attention in a big way, in media and awards. In May, 2019 she was featured on the cover of Frieze, the prestigious European art magazine, and in mid-June she was selected by an international jury as the Art Basel and BMW Art Journey winner.</p>

			<p>All wired and blue-haired, Lu Yang is a Shanghai-based multimedia artist who in conversation during a studio visit and subsequently over dinner (where she was seated with her adorable pug) revealed that she is deeply immersed in the subcultures of anime, manga, video games, and sci-fi. In artworks that include animated films, performance, and video game-like installation, Yang creates fantastical, often morbid visions of sexuality, mental illness, and imaginary deities that fuse ideas from traditional Chinese medicine with those of futurist Goth anarchy.</p>

			<p>Mr Simon admires artists who refashion ideas, images, and concepts that we thought we knew, for the purpose of showing us more about who we really are. Lu Yang is a brilliant comet lighting up the skies. Keep your eyes on her!</p>

			<h1>Tishan Hsu &mdash; In the Halls and On&nbsp;the Walls</h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/2/00ec8488-98af-465e-a4df-9588f6c73f78.jpeg">
			<p>Mr Simon bumped into master painter and multimedia artist Tishan Hsu recently, while walking the halls of the Frieze New York art fair. There, we got the chance to show him the photos we’d taken of his superb futurist decay exhibition at Hong Kong’s Empty Gallery, one of that city’s hippest commercial art-showing spaces. At the same time we caught that show, several of Hsu’s works were also featured in the K11 Art Foundation’s Glow Like That group show.</p>

			<p>For more than three decades, Hsu has been making painted, collaged, and sculpted works that sensually ask “How do we embody technology?” But the Empty Galley show represents the first time the Boston-born, Brooklyn-based artist has had a solo show in China. Since we first included Tishan Hsu in a Soho group exhibition in 1983 we’ve been admiring his consistent and unwavering vision of how our minds and memories have been wrapped and warped by technology. Hsu’s ascension and recognition today is an inspiration for all of us to keep the faith and keep following our vision!</p>

			<h1>The K11 Shopping Experience</h1>
			<p class="lead">Curated by Venus Lau for K11</p>

			<img src="/assets/img/2/IMG_2593.jpeg" alt="">

			<p>Since its soft opening in 2013, Shanghai K11 has captured the hearts of the city’s cultural and fashion elite. The art mall’s customers are mainly fashionistas between 25 and 40 years old, with plenty of spending power; its foot traffic is close to a million people per month and continuing to increase. The mall has seen numerous first-tier brands open their doors and achieve impressive sales volume there, often with exclusive, limited-edition, and must-have merchandise that sells out quickly. </p>

			<p>The energy of the place is amazing! Its restaurants are packed every day and its program of must-see art exhibitions and creative performances make it a unique art playground. Mr Simon loves art, cultured adventure, new ideas, and new ways of experiencing and decoding beautiful things in the world—so a tip of the hat to K11 for creating a turbocharged site for delivering that total experience!</p>

			<h1>What We're Listening to Right Now: <em>Eat Or Die</em></h1>

			<img src="/assets/img/2/Future-Orients_Running_video.png">

			<p>Eat Or Die, the debut album of rock band Future Orients, was released in 2016 by pioneering indie label Maybe Mars, seen by many as one of China’s most interesting hubs of underground music. The album, a fusion of psychedelic rock, indie electro, and classic punk, is completely catchy-- and as a bonus, the playful video of one of its tracks, “Running,.” includes a dazzling array of collaged elements (including Picasso’s Guernica).</p>

			<p>Says UCCC Director Philip Tinari: “Evolving out of a planned live concert series for the exhibition Voluntary Garden—UCCA’s last exhibition to open before the outbreak—this event was hosted on video platform Kuaisou with the support of Shanghai Tang…. As we wait to see what kind of changed world will emerge, we reaffirm, through our daily work, our belief in the unique and fundamental power of art to inspire reflection, enable dialogue, and envision solidarity.”</p>

			<h6>ABOUT</h6>
			<p>Caroline Hu’s 2019 couture collection-- her very first!-- was a break-out success for which she won a $100,000 BoF (Business of Fashion) China prize. Inspired by an Henri Matisse painting, she created the ten dresses using a hand-made smocking machine to make coloured clouds of tucked and pulled fabrics. Says the designer, “I play with the smocking machine as though I am painting….”</p>

			<p>The designer was born in Shenzhen, China; studied pattern making in Beijing; schooled at Central Saint Martins (London) and Parsons (New York); and now lives in New York City.</p>
